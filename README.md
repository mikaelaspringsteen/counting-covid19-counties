## Introduction

This Shiny dashboard is a tool for exploring the quantification of COVID-19 at a county level. Select variables to highlight counties and compare in-group and overall means.

Remember that visualizations like this can often tell us more about a region's testing capacity and reporting infrastructure than about the number of infections or deaths actually present at any given time.

Questions, suggestions, or requests for additional stats or functionalities to be added to the app can be directed to contactmspringsteen@gmail.com

The app is updated daily to reflect changes to the underlying data.

## Data

COVID-19 metrics are drawn from the [Johns Hopkins CSSE COVID-19 repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData). Data about [poverty, education, unemployment, economic type, and metropolitan status](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/county-level-data-sets/download-data/), [population](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-counties-detail.html), and [employment, household size, housing, and insurance](https://data.census.gov/) are drawn from the US Census.
